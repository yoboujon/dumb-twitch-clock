# dumbTwitchClock (dTC)
a dumb clock for your streams, it generates a text file with the amount of time your prompted

# First use
The program can be started with any Windows system (Later Linux will be included).
It will asks the user for a time to be set up.
Then it will asks if the numbers entered are correct.

# The Clock
After all the settings put in place, the clock will start in the prompt.
A known bug is that when it's 0:0:0, the clock doesn't stop and proceed with 0:59:59.
I will check this out.

-> Next time it will be displayed in a text file
-> The text showed will be with two digits for both minutes and seconds (so 00,01,02... through 10)
